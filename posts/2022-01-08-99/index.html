    <p>I am going to wrap up #100daystooffload with my next article. As I mentioned before, there were a couple of reasons I liked to participate in this challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to have a blog for a long time</li>
<li>100daystooffload gives you a chance to write tech articles different from those you see often in the web</li>
<li>I liked the idea to offload things, which I kept thinking about for longer</li>
</ul>
<p>Articles are often much like &ldquo;hey I figured this out and I am one of the first who did and like to tell you about it&rdquo;. But the setting of this challenge is different and allows you to just write what you like to write about.</p>
<p>I think I haven&rsquo;t offloaded all those things from the past couple of years. The reason is I now see this blog as some kind of room and all the articles could be little paintings hanging at the wall, or sculptures. Soon it&rsquo;ll be done and no new pieces will be added to that room. But it&rsquo;s a place I can go to, I can also shut the door and leave it like it is.</p>
<p>Some things I don&rsquo;t want to be in there. They&rsquo;re disappearing anyway and become less and less important and I hope it stays that way.</p>
<p><em>This is day 99 of my <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100daystooffload</a> series, a challenge to write 100 blog posts within the time of a year.</em></p>
