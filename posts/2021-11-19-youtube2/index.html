  I like that her schedule differs from the standard one.

<p>I like that her schedule differs from the standard one. So she is not working 9-5pm with a short lunch break and working out at night, or in the morning hours, but she&rsquo;s finishing up her day early in the afternoon to enjoy the sunlight and do some sports, and then she continues studying at night.</p>
<p>I really do think a similar schedule works best for me. Actually what I know is working is exercising at noon and having lunch afterwards. I am usually very concentrated in the afternoon then and can keep it up quite long. Still I feel like a nice human being at night then. :)</p>
<p>Also, Xiuwen teaches me to drink tea more often and to watch funny videos during the day.</p>
