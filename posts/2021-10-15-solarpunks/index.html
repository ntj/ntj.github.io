<meta property="og:description" content="Last night I had a conversation about solarpunks. I remembered in 2019, I&rsquo;ve been to San Diego to attend the DjangoCon conference and TwitchCon was happening at the same time. It was the first time I heard about Twitch and the city was crowded and you saw many people dressed up as steam punks. I think the term steam punk I learned those days as well.
So I thought, maybe there is a new platform X, I&rsquo;m not hip enough to know about yet and if there woudn&rsquo;t be a pandemic solar punks meet at Xcon, the platforms conference." />

    <p>Last night I had a conversation about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunks">solarpunks</a>. I remembered in 2019, I&rsquo;ve been to San Diego to attend the DjangoCon conference and TwitchCon was happening at the same time. It was the first time I heard about Twitch and the city was crowded and you saw many people dressed up as steam punks. I think the term steam punk I learned those days as well.</p>
<p>So I thought, maybe there is a new platform X, I&rsquo;m not hip enough to know about yet and if there woudn&rsquo;t be a pandemic solar punks meet at Xcon, the platforms conference. Or maybe the conference is taking place online and this is already happening.</p>
