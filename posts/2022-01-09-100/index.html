My roundup following Doug Belshaw&rsquo;s post a little.
It took me 339 days to finish. I wrote about programming and people I find inspiring, about communities and platforms.
I think I learned a few things along the way, writing a blog post was a motivation to try something which could eventually help me for my job. Summarizing and to put it in own words gives me a way to look up and recall terms and concepts." />

    <p>Today I completed #100daystooffload!</p>
<p>My roundup following <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2021/04/17/100-days-of-100daystooffload/">Doug Belshaw&rsquo;s</a> post a little.</p>
<p><img src="/img/lightbulbs.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>It took me 339 days to finish. I wrote about programming and people I find inspiring, about communities and platforms.</p>
<p>I think I learned a few things along the way, writing a blog post was a motivation to try something which could eventually help me for my job. Summarizing and to put it in own words gives me a way to look up and recall terms and concepts. Also it helped lettings things to.</p>
<p>I just can recommend to try it out yourself! Either privately in a journal, or by participating in that challenge.</p>
<p>So my blogging project will pause. If I feel like writing there are other options, like working on another Wikipedia article.</p>
<p><em>This is day 100 of my <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100daystooffload</a> series, a challenge to write 100 blog posts within the time of a year.</em></p>
