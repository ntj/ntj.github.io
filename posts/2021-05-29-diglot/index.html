    <p>When I started this blog, I was wondering, whether I should write in German or in English.
Actually I really wanted to write about tech topics in German, because there&rsquo;s a ton
of English content about tech, but there&rsquo;s less in German. You could say, well, Germans usually speak and understand English well enough so that should not be a big deal but there&rsquo;s another side to it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of efforts to localize content in science and in tech
and I think it lowers barriers and deepens understanding if you can read an learn about
something new in your mother tongue.</p>
<p>For instance there are TedX talks in Spanish, French and other languages. There is <a href="https://www.biointeractive.org/es">HHMI&rsquo;s BioInteractive</a>
effort to provide educational material for the life science in Spanish.</p>
<p>But I do want to connect to the world and announce articles on Fosstodon, the mastodon community I joined in January and where I heard first about
#100daystooffload. Fosstodon is an English-speaking community. But it&rsquo;s kind of unfair
to announce an article in English which is finally written in German.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the plan: Articles which I like to announce on Fosstodon will be in English.</p>
<p><em>This is day 38 of my <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100daystooffload</a> series, a challenge to write 100 blog posts in a year.</em></p>
