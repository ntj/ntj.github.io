    <p>That was 2021 &ndash; the second year of the pandemic. I struggled less than in 2020 I believe. It was good to participate in #100daystooffload. Perhaps a mistake, too, it is hard to say. Isn&rsquo;t it just time-consuming and pointless?</p>
<p>I am still recovering from surgery because of my broken foot and I am with constant headaches. I have headaches occasionally but just for a day and then they disappear. Now I have headaches every day for a week or longer and I hope it is nothing serious which comes from my medication.</p>
<p>I need to slow down extra activites in 2022. Obviously #100daystooffload will be completed then, maybe the rest will be fine or I need to step out of some other stuff, too.</p>
<p><em>This is day 93 of my <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100daystooffload</a> series, a challenge to write 100 blog posts in a year.</em></p>
