When I started this blog, I was wondering, whether I should write in German or in English.
Actually I really wanted to write about tech topics in German, because there's a ton
of English content about tech, but there's less German content. You could say, well
Germans usually speak and understand English well enough, especially when it comes
to IT so that should not be a big deal but there's another side to it.

I noticed there are a lot of efforts to localize content in science and in tech
and I think it lowers barriers and deepens understanding if you can read an learn about
something in your mother tongue.

For instance there exist TedX talks in Spanish and French. There is [HHMI's BioInteractive](https://www.biointeractive.org/es)
effort to provide educational material for the life science in Spanish.

But I do want to connect to the world and announce some articles once in a while in
fosstodon, the mastodon community I joined in January and where I heard first about
#100daystooffload. Fosstodon is an English-speaking community. But it's kind of unfair
to announce an article in English which is finally written in German.

So that's the plan: Articles I like to announce at fosstodon will be in English.
But already now I just put those little articles in between, which do not all mention in social media.
Those will still be German.

_This is day 38 of my [#100daystooffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) series, a challenge to write 100 blog posts in a year._
