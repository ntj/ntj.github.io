    <p>In our FSFE Women meetings, we usually propose a topic for the next upcoming meeting. I suggested I present women-related papers in computer science and gender aspects of teaching and learning computer science, because I came across a couple of papers about that topic and I think I can speak to them.</p>
<p>So in this post, and there might more coming, I will start collecting papers and some thoughts about those.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this list are just papers I came across or I found interesting, it&rsquo;s not an exhausting list of the topic and there might be authors one should know, I just don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<h3 id="gender-differences-in-scratch-programs-of-primary-school-children">Gender Differences in Scratch Programs of Primary School Children</h3>
<p>by Alexandra Funke, Katharina Geldreich</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3137065.3137067?casa_token=iQAvm2UQJvIAAAAA:uTLehs2IxmH8a00YB-6830pS2dUdsEL8iRCjuNU_QKKO9qTj9_PILKihRT9oeZH7VQlEnZernJy1">Link</a></p>
<p>They give some theoretical background and related work on the topic of gender differences of programming.</p>
<p>They developed a programming course for students of fourth grade of primary schools</p>
<p>They chose a topic for programming, which was Circus! They hoped to attract both girls and
boys equally by this metaphor.</p>
<p>Teaching computer science unplugged (social activities)</p>
<p>Goal: Investigate relationship between the student&rsquo;s gender and the characteristics of the program they created.</p>
<p>Analysed the programs and which blocks (programming concepts) girls and boys used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We observe that male students use twice as often Motion blocks. Female
students instead use twice as oÂ‰en blocks out of the Look section. The usage of Control and Event blocks are nearly the same for both groups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They also analyzed interaction and found</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the projects which contain keyboard control were made by boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An important observation is that the girls produced much more Story-programs (79 % of these were made by girls). Against this, male students developed more
programs which were categorized as Game (90 % of these were
made by boys). Animation programs were made 50 % of boys and
50 % of girls.&rdquo;</p>
