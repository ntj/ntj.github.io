    <p>This weekend I came across an episode of the podcast Chaos Radio Express: <a href="https://cre.fm/cre220-sprechendes-denken">Sprechendes Denken</a>.</p>
<p>Moritz Klenk has created the podcast &ldquo;Podlog&rdquo; in 2017 in which he publishes an episode each and every day throughout a whole year. The episodes were all monologues. Moritz is talking to himself, mainly about his work, which was a PhD thesis about aspects of religion and science in context of the internet. Finally, the podcast project became his thesis! It&rsquo;s interesting to hear from Moritz how talking to himself and recording that changed his way of thinking over time and gave him a basis to analyse his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sprechendes Denken&rdquo; highly reminded of #100daystooffload. Publishing each and every day is a lot, but 100 articles in a year is quite an amount, too. I knew, I had to publish ~33 articles by the end of May and there should be 40 articles by the end of June. I like to slow down during the summer months, so I should publish more beforehand. I was falling behind, in the beginning, I threw out an article almost every day. But I have a list of eight topics at the moment, which I like to write about and this list has never been empty.</p>
<p>This blog gives me the ability to see, which topics matter to me and when. I noticed, that there are &ldquo;seasons&rdquo;, new topics pop up, stay for a while and also go again. I like to experiment more with programming, and also want to write about that, so when I&rsquo;m &ldquo;offloaded&rdquo;, maybe I can get that going again.</p>
<p><em>This is day 40 of my <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100daystooffload</a> series, a challenge to write 100 blog posts in a year.</em></p>
