<p>by Juliane Siegeris <a href="https://delfi-tagung.de/fileadmin/TG/DELFI/HDI_2021/5410_HDI-Tagungsband_-_Broschuere_-_L11_so.pdf">Link (p 65)</a></p>
<p>The author presents a women-only college program to get a degree in computer science and economy. It has been started in 2009 and it is one of six mono-educational college programs in Germany. It is 6 semester program to receive a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 3 years.</p>
<p>The goal is to raise the numbers female graduates in selected STEM fields.</p>
<p>The paper discusses the motivation for the program, the concept and strategy to attain female students, and diversity aspects of the student body.</p>
<p>The research is based on surveys conducted within the students since 2015.</p>
<p>First results show, that women are being attracted by this special program, who otherwise ould not have studied computer science.</p>
<p>The questions the authors ask, is, is there a way to contribute to diversity (of the IT workforce) with the help of mono-educational program_ Maybe also, how diverse is the student body itself.</p>
<p>The results show, that the student body of this degree is very international and very diverse with respect to age, origin, IT-experience, education.</p>
<p>The conclusion they draw is, that more women are getting access to the IT job market which is somethings the industry wants.</p>
<p>Still a lot of questions are open, but I find it interesting to see, that women choose this program, also because it&rsquo;s womens only. What effects does that have on your motivation to study computer science?</p>
